# JetsProject

# Overview
This program contains a text.file with a list of brooms from Harry Potter. Each broom has a speed, range, and price associated with the model. When the program is launched, the user is giving a menu to choose from a menu. They have many options to choose from such as view all brooms in the hidden text.file, view the fastest broom model or even add to/remove brooms from the list as they please. 

Behind the scenes of the program, the text.file is thrown into an arrayList via a readList method, which uses a fileReader constructor. After the text.file has been accessed, the program was able to pass information throughout the various methods to obtain information for the user to interact with.

# Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse

# Lessons Learned 
This program has taught me how to properly add and remove items to a text.file. I initially had issues properly reading the file into the program, until I realized I needed to use if statements for the program to figure out where each jet belongs. I also learned how to properly put a method call inside of a while loop, which I had originally thought that a while loop was only used within a method. Overall, I had fun throughout the creation of the program, as I was able to use a little bit of creativity. I will definitely be making attempts to enhance the prrogram for the users to interact with it more.
